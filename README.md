## Project description

The intent of the project is to programmatically create a logo in the form of a [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) based on user input.

## Application functionality

Using the command line interface (`CLI`), the user of the application can:
1. select up to three characters for the logo text and from three shapes: a circle, square or triangle

2. use [svg color keywords]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/SVG_Recognized_color_keyword_names.svg) or hexadecimal values for the text and shape colors

## Technology used

The application was built using [node.js, v18.17.0](https://nodejs.org/en), an asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime designed to build scalable network applications, [npm inquirer, v8.2.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), a collection of common interactive command line user interfaces, and [jest, 9.6.2](https://jestjs.io/), a *delightful* JavaScript test framework.

Additionally, the generated `svg` logo includes an inline, embedded font (`roboto condensed sans serif`) from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The `inquirer` module has been extended and uses the [maxlength-input-prompt, v1.0.2](https://github.com/jwarby/inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt) which simplifies the implementation, usability and testing of the application.

## Usage instructions

<details>
<summary> Expand for installation, usage and generated logo details.</summary>

1. **Installation**

    *prerequisites:*
    
    [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

    [required packages, link to package.json in github repository](https://github.com/thoughtsinbuttermilk/10-ModuleChallenge-SVGLogoMaker-sambailey/blob/a6165d792efc7fb656f1b2b635ee339fb8d9e64d/package.json)


   • Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:thoughtsinbuttermilk/10-ModuleChallenge-SVGLogoMaker-sambailey.git`

   •  Install and launch VS Code

   • In the `terminal`, use `npm` to install required packages

2. **Usage, CLI**

    Run the application by entering `node index.js` in the `terminal` and follow the prompts

3. **Generated logo**
   
    After running the application, a file named `logo.svg` will be generated in the root of the repository
</details>

## Testing

The application is lightly guarded with `jest` unit tests. After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, the tests can be run by typing `jest` in the root of the local repository. All tests are in a passing state when run against `main`.

## Video walkthrough

Please see [this video](./examples/videowalktrhoughs/runtheapplication.mov) which will  show you how the application is run in the terminal.
